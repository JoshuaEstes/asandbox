# Two users by default: a superadmin (we suggest reserving this account for developer use and
# removing it at production launch) and an admin (a member of the admin group). We suggest
# giving the latter account to the client. The permissions dashboard is just plain dangerous, 
# so we show only the users and groups dashboards to regular admins
